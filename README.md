# Learn OpenGL In C, not C++
This code is for those of us who use C instead of C++, for the LearnOpenGL tutorial website.  
  
Their license is the creative common license 4. So I am forced to use that license.  
  
The code is good enough to learn from, and a lot of the code I hand wrote, to get around the C++ only code.  

The C compiler I use is GCC / MinGW 64-Bit. The version I use is from this link :  
https://nuwen.net/mingw.html  
This version works great on windows. Linux users already have access to GCC.  
  
Make sure to look in the libs folder. That is where I kept all of my 3rd party libraries / code from outside sources. The freetype is compiled for codeblocks. So if you need freetype for visual studio or some other compiler / IDE, then you will need to get a fresh copy of freetype and compile it yourself. You can get freetype from here :  
https://freetype.org/
  
**NOTE** : I tried to stick fairly close to the libraries and folder structure, so that it would be easier to follow along his tutorials.
